            After defeating the Romans at the Battle of Lake Trasimene, Hannibal now moved his forces down south.  There was panic in Rome and Quintus Fabius Maximus was appointed dictator to deal with Hannibal.  Fabius, however, refused to meet Hannibal in the open field and this strategy became highly unpopular in Rome. 
        </p>
        
        <p id="p2"> 
            The Romans were then forced to retreat to Rome.  It was a total defeat.
        </p>
        
        <p>
            After the horrific defeat at the Battle of Cannae, the Romans reinstituted Fabius' avoidance strategy.  The Romans no longer refused to meet Hannibal in head on collisons.  
        </p>
        
        <p>
            The avoidance strategy worked but it took forever.  It took almost two long decades to drive Hannibal out of Italy.  And even then Hannibal was never defeated in Italy.
