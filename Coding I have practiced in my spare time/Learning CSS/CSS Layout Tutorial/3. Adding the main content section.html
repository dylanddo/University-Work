        <h1>HANNIBAL - THE BATTLE OF CANNAE</h1>
       
        <p>
            After defeating the Romans at the Battle of Lake Trasimene, Hannibal now moved his forces down south.  There was panic in Rome 
            and Quintus Fabius Maximus was appointed dictator to deal with Hannibal.  Fabius, however, refused to meet Hannibal in the 
            open field and this strategy became highly unpopular in Rome.  Romans were used to attacking, not hiding.  The Romans were 
            forced to go on the offensive after Hannibal positioned his forces betweeen Rome and it's vital grain supply.  This setup the 
            epic Battle of Cannae. Here Hannibal defeated the Romans inflicting the worst single day defeat in Rome's history.
        </p>

        <h1>AFTERMATH OF THE BATTLE OF CANNAE</h1>

        <p>
            After the horrific defeat at the Battle of Cannae, the Romans reinstituted Fabius' avoidance strategy.  The Romans no longer 
            refused to meet Hannibal in head on collisons.  Rather the Roman army kept a watchful eye on Hannibal, but always at a close 
            distance.
        </p>
        
        <p>
            The avoidance strategy worked but it took forever.  It took almost two long decades to drive Hannibal out of Italy.  And even 
            then Hannibal was never defeated in Italy.  The Romans, adopting a tactic out of Hannibal's playbook, launched an attack against 
            Carthage itself. This forced Hannibal to travel back to Africa to defend the city.  Here he was defeated at the Battle of Zama.
