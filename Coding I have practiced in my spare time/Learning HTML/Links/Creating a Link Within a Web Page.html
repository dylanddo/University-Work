   <h2> <a name="when"></a> When to get a test</h2>
   <p>If you have coronavirus symptoms, apply as soon as you can.</p>

     <p> <mark>Do not wait: <br/>You need to get the test done in the first 5 days of having symptoms.</mark> </p> 
      
      <p>Book a visit to a test site to have the test today. Or order a home test kit if you cannot get to a test site.</p>
      
      <p>On days 1 to 4 of your symptoms, you can get tested at a site or at home. If you're ordering a home test kit on day 4, do it by 3pm.</p>
      
      <p>On day 5, you need to go to a test site. It's too late to order a home test kit.</p>

      <p>
         <mark>
            Stay at home if you have symptoms: <br/>
            If you are getting a test because you have symptoms, you and anyone you live with must stay at home (self-isolate) until you get your result.<br/>

            Anyone in your support bubble must also self-isolate until you get your result.

   <h2> <a name="what"></a> What the test involves</h2>
   <p>The test involves taking a swab of the inside of your nose and the back of your throat, using a long cotton bud.<p/>
      <p>You can do the swab yourself (if you are aged 12 or over) or someone can do it for you. Parents or guardians have to swab test children aged 11 or under.</p>

<h2> <a name="getting"></a> Getting a test for someone else</h2>

<p>If other people you live with have symptoms, you can order tests for up to 3 of them.</p>
