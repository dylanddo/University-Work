This was my first assignment working with GUIs. I utlised various elements of JFrame like JPanels and buttons while learning about other classes such the an action and event listeners.

So with this I managed to create my own miniture verison of mindsweeper where the objective is to make sure you don't select the panel with a bomb in it. 

There are 3 difficulties which allow you to choose how many points is required to win: 
Easy for 5 points
Intermediate for 7 points
Difficult for 10 points

Feel free to play.
